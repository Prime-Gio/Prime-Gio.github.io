    <img src="../images/movie.png" alt="Night view of The Silver Haven" width="350" height="150">
  <p>Elevate your movie night—literally. Join your neighbors on the rooftop terrace as we screen an '80s classic against the backdrop of the city skyline at sunset. We’re trading stadium seating for cozy bean bags, lounge chairs, and plush blankets.
<br><br>Arrive during "golden hour" to grab your spot and socialize. We will be providing gourmet popcorn (think truffle salt and caramel drizzle) and elevated movie theater candy. It’s BYOB (Bring Your Own Beverage) and BYO-Cozy Blanket.

  <h3>The Big Summer Excursion Amusement Park</h3>

  <p>Ready to scream your lungs out? Skip the exhausting drive and the expensive parking fees! We are organizing an exclusive community day trip to The Big Summer Excursion Amusement Park.<br><br>
     Join your neighbors for an adrenaline-fueled day riding the tallest coasters and enjoying iconic park snacks. We’ve secured a discounted group rate that includes admission and a seat on our private, 
     air-conditioned charter bus, picking you up right outside the leasing office. Whether you’re a thrill-seeker looking for the fastest drop or just want to enjoy a funnel cake while strolling the midway, this is the easiest way to experience the park.</p>
